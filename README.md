# 🚀 AutoRoot – System Failure Analyzer

AutoRoot is an **AI-powered system failure analysis tool** that simulates how modern **SRE / DevOps teams** detect anomalies and identify root causes in production systems.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does
- 📊 Generates **synthetic system telemetry** (CPU, Memory, Latency, Error Rate)
- 🤖 Detects anomalies using **unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest)**
- 🧠 Correlates system metrics to infer **probable root causes**
- 🔗 Serves predictions via a **FastAPI backend**
- 🖥️ Provides an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for analysis

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)  
- ⚡ FastAPI (Backend API)  
- 🎛️ Streamlit (Frontend Dashboard)  
- ☁️ Google Colab + Ngrok (Deployment)

---

## 🎯 Why This Project?
This project demonstrates how **AI can be applied to observability and incident analysis**, similar to tools used in real-world **SRE and DevOps workflows**.

It focuses on:
- End-to-end system design  
- ML-driven anomaly detection  
- Practical AI integration with backend & UI
